# Demand Forecasting in Online Hotel Bookings

## Overview
This project aimed to predict the likelihood of a user booking a hotel based on their search query and hotel properties. The dataset originated from a former Kaggle competition and contained information about user search queries, hotel properties, and whether the user clicked on or booked the hotel.

## Approach
The project followed the typical data mining process, including:

1. **Business Understanding**: Exploring related work and understanding the problem domain.
2. **Data Understanding**: Performing exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and its characteristics.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and engineering new features.
4. **Modeling and Evaluation**: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning models, including an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model and an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model.
5. **Deployment**: Discussing how the model could be deployed in a scalable way at Expedia.

## Key Components
The key components of this project include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the dataset to gain insights and identify relevant features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the available data to improve the model's performance.
3. **LSTM Model**: Implementing and tuning a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture the temporal patterns in the data.
4. **ARIMA Model**: Developing an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast the booking likelihood.
5. **Evaluation and Deployment**: Assessing the performance of the LSTM and ARIMA models and discussing their potential deployment in a real-world scenario.
